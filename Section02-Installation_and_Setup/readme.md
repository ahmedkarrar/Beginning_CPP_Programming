- Instructor prefers [CodeLite](https://codelite.org/) but I am already using VSCode and [Section 22](https://github.com/yanth0nyy/Beginning_CPP_Programming/tree/master/Section22-Bonus_Section-Using_Visual_Studio_Code) walks through VSCode installation, building and running C++ programs.
- I also started learning C++ programming with free and online platform. So I had most of the basic set up per [Microsoft's instuctions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac)
    - Notice the insturctor prefers `g++` over `clang`, `c++17` over `c++20`, and using another debugger. They are all documented under [Section 22](https://github.com/yanth0nyy/Beginning_CPP_Programming/tree/master/Section22-Bonus_Section-Using_Visual_Studio_Code).
