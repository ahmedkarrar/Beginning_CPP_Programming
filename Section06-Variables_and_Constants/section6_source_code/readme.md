# What is a varialbe

- A variable is an abstraction for a memory location
- Allow programmer to use meaningful names and not memory addresses
- Variables have
    - Type: their category
    - Value: the contents
- Variables **must** be declared before they are used
- Variables value may change

# Declaring and Initializing Variables

## Naming variables

- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Must begin with a letter or underscore
    - cannot begin with a number
- Cannot use C++ reserved keywords i.e. `int int`
- Cannot redeclare a name in the same scope
    - C++ is case sensitive: upper case and lower case are different variables

## Style and Best Practices

- Be consistent with naming conventions
    - `myVariableName` vs `my_variable_name`
    - avoid beginning names with underscores
- Use meaningful names
    - not too long and not too short
- Never use variables before initializing them
- Declare variables close to when you need them in your code
